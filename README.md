# Hide Reddit Trash

This is a userscript that hides the links on the Hacker News homepage.

## Install

This is distributed as a userscript, so you need a browser extension that runs userscripts.

[Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) can be installed in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers. [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) works in Safari.

Then, visit [hide_hacker_news_stories.user.js](https://github.com/ludios/hide-hacker-news-stories/raw/master/hide_hacker_news_stories.user.js) and _Confirm installation_.

(Alternatively, create a new script and paste in the entire <code>hide_hacker_news_stories.user.js</code> source.)
